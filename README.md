# Comfort Foot Clinic — Static Website

This is a small static website scaffold for a podiatry practice. It includes a homepage with services, about, testimonials, and a contact form.

Files added:
- `index.html` — homepage
- `css/styles.css` — styles and responsive layout
- `js/script.js` — footer year + simple form validation/feedback

How to view locally:
1. Open the folder in your editor.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open With).

Notes / next steps:
- Replace placeholder text, phone number, and emojis with real content and images in `img/`.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or form service for real submissions.
- Add real accessibility labels, WCAG testing, and SEO metadata per clinic needs.
